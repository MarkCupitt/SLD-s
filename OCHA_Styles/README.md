OCHA_Styles
===========

This is a repository of the OCHA-specific files, of which there are 17 different layers, each with several layer types. We have folders for both English and Spanish related layers. Most layer folders have Shapefiles, SLDs, and schema. These layers are created from the OCHA Humanitarian symbol set. There is also a folder containing all of the OCHA humanitarian symbols or icons (in PNG format). These icons are from the August 2012 update. 

The symbols were provided by OCHA at Reliefweb: http://reliefweb.int/map/world/world-humanitarian-and-country-icons-2012.
